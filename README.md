# Weather App - Android (Java)

## App Introduction

Welcome to the **Weather App**! üåçüå¶Ô∏è

This Android app allows users to get the current weather of a location by either:
- **Searching for a location by name** using **Google Location Search** (Autocomplete).
- **Allowing location permissions** to fetch the weather based on the user's current **latitude** and **longitude** using **FusedLocationProviderClient**.

### Features:
- **Search by Place Name**: Use Google Places Autocomplete to search for any location by name. Once a location is selected, the app fetches weather data for that location.
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- **Current Location Weather**: Fetch the user's current location (latitude and longitude) using FusedLocationProviderClient and show the weather for that location.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with location search and weather details.
